## Theory

1. Generate 4x8 white noise.

2. Change the state according to the following rules.

   - Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
   - Any dead cell with one or less live neighbors becomes a live cell.
   - All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

3. Repeat steps 2 several times.
